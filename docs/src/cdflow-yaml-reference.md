# `cdflow.yaml`

cdflow.yaml is a metadata file you place in the root of your project
controlling how cdflow2 builds and deploys your code.

## Full Example

```yml
# required - always "2" for cdflow2
version: 2

# required - descibed below
config:
  image: mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-simple
  params:
    # parameters are specific to the config image you are using
    default-region: eu-west-1

# how to build your code - described below
builds:
  docker:
    image: mergermarket/cdflow2-build-docker-ecr
  lambda:
    image: mergermarket/cdflow2-build-lambda
    params:
      # some build images (like this one) take additional
      # configuration parameters (it's docker all the way down
      # for this image!)
      image: node:12
      cmd: npm run build

# required - the terraform docker image to use
terraform:
  image: hashicorp/terraform:0.12.23
```

## Reference

### `version` (required)

For cdflow2 this should always be the string value `2` - this is to
prevent you accidentally using the wrong version. For example:

```yaml
version: 2
```

### `config` (required)

Config is used to select and configure the container that sets up the
environment for building and deploying the service. For example:

```yaml
config:
  image: mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-simple
  params:
    # parameters are specific to the config image you are using
    default-region: eu-west-1
```

#### `config > image` (required)

The docker image to use for config. Examples include:

* [`mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-simple:latest`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-simple) -
  a config image for a simple setup with a single AWS account.
* [`mergermarket/cdflow2-config-acuris:latest`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-config-acuris) -
  a config image teams deploying with Acuris infrastructure.

#### `config > params` (optional)

A dictionary of parameters passed to the config container. What
parameters are supported depends on the config image used, so check
the specific documentation for that image.

### `builds` (optional)

Builds contains a dictionary of named builds that will be built when you
run `cdflow2 release` - e.g. building a docker image or lambda zip. For
example:

```yaml
builds:
  docker:
    image: mergermarket/cdflow2-build-docker-ecr
```

#### `builds > [name] > image` (required)

The image used to do the build. Examples include:

* [`mergermarket/cdflow2-release-docker-ecr:latest`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-release-docker-ecr)
* [`mergermarket/cdflow2-release-lambda:latest`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-release-lambda)

#### `builds > [name] > params` (optional)

A dictionary of parameters passed to the build container. What parameters
are supported depends on the build container used, so check the specific
documentation for that image.

### `terraform > image` (required)

The [terraform docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/terraform)
to use to run [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). The exact docker
image will be maintained through the pipeline, but it is probably still
a good idea to pin the version since once you update a state file with
a newer version (e.g. with a `terraform apply` when you `cdflow2 deploy`)
it is not possible to go back to the older version. For example:

```yaml
terraform:
  image: hashicorp/terraform:0.12.24
```
