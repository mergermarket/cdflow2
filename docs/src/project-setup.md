# Project Setup

This guide covers setting up a project to use `cdflow2`. It assumes you have already [installed cdflow2](installation).

## Git repository

To deploy a project with cdflow2 it needs a git repo. For example use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create) to create a repo:

```shell
# change "myorg" and "myrepo" to something that makes sense for you
gh repo create myorg/myrepo
cd myrepo
```

## `cdflow.yaml` Boilerplate

Copy the following into a file in the root called `cdflow.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 2
team: TODO
config:
  image: TODO
  params:
builds:
terraform:
  image: hashicorp/terraform:0.12.23
```

Replace the value for `team` with the name of your team in [kebab case](https://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase)
(i.e `lower-case-with-hyphens`).

See [cdflow.yaml reference](cdflow-yaml-reference).

## Config Image

The second `TODO` is the image used to configure your build & deployment. A good choice if you're starting
out deploying to AWS is:

```yaml
config:
  image: mergermarket/cdflow-config-aws-simple
```

Available config images include:

* [`mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-simple`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-simple) -
  a config image for a simple setup with a single AWS account.
* [`mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-multi`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-config-aws-multi) -
  a config image for a setup wtih multiple teams deploying to multiple
  AWS accounts, for larger organisations.

## Configure Builds

If you need to one or more builds for your release - e.g. a docker container or lambda function - then
add to the `builds` section of cdflow.yaml. For example, to do a [docker](https://www.docker.com/) build and upload it to [ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/):

```yaml
builds:
  docker:
    image: mergermarket/cdflow-release-docker-ecr
```

Available build images include:

* [`mergermarket/cdflow2-release-docker-ecr`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-release-docker-ecr).
* [`mergermarket/cdflow2-release-lambda`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-release-lambda).

## Setup

Now that you've chosen a config image and build images, you can complete your setup interactively with:

```shell
cdflow2 setup
```

The options will depend on the chosen config container.

## Terraform

Terraform code should be placed in an `infra/` folder - by convention in the following files:

### `infra/variables.tf`

The following [variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) should be defined:

```terraform
variable "release" {
  type        = "map"
  description = "release metadata: version, commit, component & team"
}
```

In addition each build will result in additional map being provided - e.g. if you have have a
[`mergermarket/cdflow2-release-docker-ecr`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/mergermarket/cdflow2-release-docker-ecr) build under a "docker" key:

```terraform
variable "docker" {
  type        = "map"
  description = "release data from cdflow2-release-docker-ecr: image_id"
}
```

In addition you can declare additional environment specific variables - see below for how to provide the values.

### `infra/main.tf`

This is where you put your terraform code. In addition to the variables you've declared, you can also access the name of the the environment with the `terraform.workspace` value.

### `infra/outputs.tf`

Any [outputs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html) you declare here will appear in the build output for your pipeline.

### `infra/backend.tf`

This file contains a [partial backend configuration](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/config.html#partial-configuration)
and will be created for you automatically when you deploy. There's no need to add any additional configuraiton as this is
provided by the config container you are using. This file can safely be ignored or committed - run the following from the
project root to ignore it:

```shell
echo backend.tf >> infra/.gitignore
git commit -m 'ignore generated backend.tf file' infra/.gitignore
```

## Config

To provide the environment specific values of any config variables you have defined (i.e. in
`infra/variables.tf`), add a [JSON tfvars file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-definitions-tfvars-files) in `config/ENV.json` - for example:

### `config/live.json`

```JSON
{
  "my_config_name": "config value for the live environment"
}
```

## Build & Deploy

Once this one-off setup has been completed, you can build and deploy your software as follows:

```shell
# choose a version number:
version=1

# build the software
cdflow2 release $version

# deploy the software to an "aslive" environment:
cdflow2 deploy aslive $version

# deploy the software to a "live" environment:
cdflow2 deploy live $version
```

### Choosing a Version Number

It is recommended to use the build number from your CI server and the short git commit, separated by
a hyphen. This will allow you to identify the build and the commit that produced it. For example if
you're using Jenkins:

```shell
# for example "101-d37bfc2"
version="$BUILD_NUMBER-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
```
